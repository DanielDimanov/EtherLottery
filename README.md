# EtherLottery

### Repository inspired and made following tutorial Udemy Ethereum, course by Stephen Grider.

### This is a simple test project for deploying a contract on the Rikesby Etherium network. The repository contains the <i>contract </i> for the lottery in the <i>contracts </i> folder. The <i>deploy </i>  and <i>compile </i> scripts are used for compiling and deploying the contract. The project is developped using web3, so you might have to have it installed first, but a definite prerequisite will be to have node installed.

## You will first need to install all dependencies using node, which you can do by doing 

1. npm install

## Then you will need to create a wallet and change the corresponding providers.

2. change line 8 and 9 in deploy.js

3. compile

4. deploy

5. Enjoy!
